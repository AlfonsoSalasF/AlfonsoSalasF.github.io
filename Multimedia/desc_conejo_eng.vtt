00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
The <b>super big</b> rabbit comes out of its burrow and stretches while yawning.

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.000
It scratches its head and walks.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.000
It scratches its right cheek with relish. It likes it. It looks at the camera with funny, crossed eyes.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The rabbit observes some daisies and runs over to smell them.

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.000
It wiggles its little tail.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Suddenly, it observes a beautiful butterfly in the sky that lands on the ground.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
An apple falls from the sky and crushes the butterfly. Catacrack.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm not writing anything else, I'm very sad for the poor butterfly.
